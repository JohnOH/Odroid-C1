Problems with kernel update being held back:
http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=117&t=9189

I beleive I followed this approach but failed to boot because the kernel had
an invalid parameter.

Recreate microSD from latest image:
http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:c1_ubuntu_release_note_v1.3

Boot.ini by default disables UHS-I support. Since boot.ini is in a FAT partition
on the microSD it is possible to edit it directly with Windows. I used the PsPad
program since there are cr/lf issues to be handled correctly. The changes I made
disblaed use of the HDMI display and so a serial console is required before all 
my changes nelow can be adopted.
I made the following changes: 
---
@@ -37,22 +37,22 @@ setenv m_bpp "32"
# UHS Card Configuration
# Uncomment the line below to __DISABLE__ UHS-1 MicroSD support
# This might break boot for some brand models of cards.
setenv disableuhs "disableuhs"


# Disable VPU (Video decoding engine, Saves RAM!!!)
# 0 = disabled
# 1 = enabled
setenv vpu "0"

# Disable HDMI Output (Again, saves ram!)
# 0 = disabled
# 1 = enabled
setenv hdmioutput "0"

# Default Console Device Setting
setenv condev "console=ttyS0,115200n8"        # on serial port
---

At boot time ssh did not allow connections, I used ttyS0 the system console to
enable it. I also needed to do:

If you download the prebuilt image from the wiki, you should take care to remove
 the included SSH host keys (rm /etc/ssh/*_key*) and generate new ones.
 
dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server

to setup the appropriate host keys.

My attempt to "Uncomment the line below to __DISABLE__ UHS-1 MicroSD support"
failed. Whilst the first boot succeeded the subsequent boot after apt-get upgrade
did not.

Expand file system to use all of microSD card.
   sudo odroid-utility.sh
Select as appropriate from the menu. This should be followed by a reboot.

Remove unused locales:
  sudo locale-gen --purge en_GB.utf8 en_US.UTF-8 && echo Success!
N.B. The mentioned locales are preserved while the rest are removed.

Tutorial
1. set debug_enable = 1 in /etc/odroid_remote.conf
2. run odroid_remote /etc/odroid_remote.conf
3. run tail -f /var/log/kern.log
4. press button on remote, you will see in console some think like that 0xAABBCCCC
AA - ignore it, BB - it is remote scan code, CCCC - it is factory code. For example:
Jan 4 21:25:29 odroid kernel: [ 300.200862@0] Wrong custom code is 0xfd020e78
Jan 4 21:25:30 odroid kernel: [ 300.973194@0] Wrong custom code is 0xf6090e78
Jan 4 21:25:31 odroid kernel: [ 302.049929@0] Wrong custom code is 0xfc030e78
Jan 4 21:25:31 odroid kernel: [ 302.554062@0] Wrong custom code is 0xfe010e78
Jan 4 21:25:32 odroid kernel: [ 303.040163@0] Wrong custom code is 0xfd020e78

In 0xfd020e78: 02 - scan code, 0e78 - factory code

5. edit /etc/odroid_remote.conf
set factory_code = 0xCCCC0001, there CCCC - factory code of your remote

6. run odroid_remote /etc/odroid_remote.conf
and press keys on remote. You will see scan codes for your remote like this:
Jan 4 21:28:04 odroid kernel: [ 455.132315@0] scancode is 0x0001, invalid key is 0x0000.
Jan 4 21:28:04 odroid kernel: [ 455.185252@0] scancode is 0x0009, invalid key is 0x0000.
Jan 4 21:28:04 odroid kernel: [ 455.427281@0] scancode is 0x0009, invalid key is 0x0000.
Jan 4 21:28:04 odroid kernel: [ 455.427461@0] scancode is 0x0009, invalid key is 0x0000.
Jan 4 21:28:04 odroid kernel: [ 455.592298@0] scancode is 0x0009, invalid key is 0x0000.
Jan 4 21:28:04 odroid kernel: [ 455.758658@0] scancode is 0x0003, invalid key is 0x0000.
Jan 4 21:28:05 odroid kernel: [ 456.111993@0] scancode is 0x0003, invalid key is 0x0000.
Jan 4 21:28:05 odroid kernel: [ 456.139341@0] scancode is 0x0000, invalid key is 0x0000.
Jan 4 21:28:05 odroid kernel: [ 456.491817@0] scancode is 0x0000, invalid key is 0x0000.

there 0x0009 is 0x09 scan code for odroid_remote.conf

7. Edit your /etc/odroid_remote.conf and assign codes to keys, like:
key_begin
0x09 105 # left key
key_end

repeat_key_begin
0x09 105 #left key
repeat_key_end

Refer to http://www.comptechdoc.org/os/linux/how ... codes.html
for linux key codes there "key number" column is wanted linux key code. Left is 105.
