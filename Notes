Problems with kernel update being held back:
http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=117&t=9189

I beleive I followed this approach but failed to boot because the kernel had
an invalid parameter.

Recreate microSD from latest image:
http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:c1_ubuntu_release_note_v1.3

Boot.ini by default disables UHS-I support. Since boot.ini is in a FAT partition
on the microSD it is possible to edit it directly with Windows. I used the PsPad
program since there are cr/lf issues to be handled correctly. The changes I made
disblaed use of the HDMI display and so a serial console is required before all 
my changes nelow can be adopted.
I made the following changes: 
---
@@ -37,22 +37,22 @@ setenv m_bpp "32"
# UHS Card Configuration
# Uncomment the line below to __DISABLE__ UHS-1 MicroSD support
# This might break boot for some brand models of cards.
setenv disableuhs "disableuhs"


# Disable VPU (Video decoding engine, Saves RAM!!!)
# 0 = disabled
# 1 = enabled
setenv vpu "0"

# Disable HDMI Output (Again, saves ram!)
# 0 = disabled
# 1 = enabled
setenv hdmioutput "0"

# Default Console Device Setting
setenv condev "console=ttyS0,115200n8"        # on serial port
---

At boot time ssh did not allow connections, I used ttyS0 the system console to
enable it. I also needed to do:

If you download the prebuilt image from the wiki, you should take care to remove
 the included SSH host keys (rm /etc/ssh/*_key*) and generate new ones.
 
dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server

to setup the appropriate host keys.

My attempt to "Uncomment the line below to __DISABLE__ UHS-1 MicroSD support"
failed. Whilst the first boot succeeded the subsequent boot after apt-get upgrade
did not.
